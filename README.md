Practice App is my second Flutter project, created as part of a structured learning process.

Although it is based on tutorial guidance, the implementation, adjustments,
and improvements are done independently as part of hands-on practice.

- Responsive layout basics
- Navigation fundamentals
- State handling
- Code organized for readability and scalability

Tech Stack:

Project Purpose

This project is focused on:
- Practicing real Flutter development workflow

- Building consistency through multiple projects

It represents a step forward from my first Flutter app and reflects progress in:
- Project structuring
- UI composition
- Debugging and iteration
